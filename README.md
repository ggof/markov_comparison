# Markov Comparison

This repo aims to regroup an implementation of Markov's chain algorithm in multiple languages to compare their relative performance. Currently, here are the contenders :
- Go
- F#
- Elixir
- Kotlin

To run each of them, you'll need the appropriate toolset. Go needs the go toolchain installed, Elixir needs Mix, F# needs DotNetCore, Kotlin needs Java 8 or more recent.
